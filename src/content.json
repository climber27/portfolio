The technique here used motion history images (MHIs) and motion energy (MEIs) to capture the activity at each frame. From there the problem of where there activity was happening in the image (translation), at what angle (rotation), and size (scale) had to be accounted for. Hu Moments gave these invariants in seven phases that could be then fed to a discriminative classifier. I chose a random forest.",
